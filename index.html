<p class="about-croissants">
  <a href="/photo.html#croissant">A croissant</a> is a buttery, flaky pastry
  that is made of layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with
  butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin
  sheet in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered,
  flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry. Although it's orignally from Austria,
  the croissant is mostly associated with France. Its name comes from its
  typical crescent shape.

  <a href="/photo.html#chocolate-croissant">A chocolate croissant</a> is made
  of the same dough as a regular croissant. It is usually filled with two
  chocolate sticks. Since it does not have a crescent shape, it's not
  called a croissant in France, but rather Pain au Chocolat (chocolate bread).
